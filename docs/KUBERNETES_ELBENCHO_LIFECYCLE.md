# Kubernetes Elbencho Lifecycle and Fault Contract

This document is the normative lifecycle and failure contract for the
asynchronous kubectl substrate of the Elbencho filesystem sweep. It freezes
the states, legal transitions, invariants, linearization points, supported
fault boundaries, and explicit non-goals against which implementation and
review are evaluated. The implementation plan explains how the feature was
built; this document defines the behavior that must remain true.

## Failure policy and boundary

Failures have three support classes:

| Class | Expected frequency | Required behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Required recovery | Medium or high | Reconcile or retry automatically within a bounded deadline. If that fails, retain recoverable state and return actionable diagnostics. |
| Required diagnosis | Low | Fail closed, preserve authoritative evidence, identify the failed invariant or operation, and give the next safe action. Bespoke automatic recovery is not required. |
| Unsupported disaster or corruption | Very low or outside the trust model | Never claim success or delete ambiguously owned resources. Detect and report the inconsistency when possible, but make no recovery promise. |

Interruption safety applies immediately before and after the external-effect
boundaries listed under [Linearization points](#linearization-points). It does
not promise recovery from a kill between every pair of shell statements.
`TERM`, `INT`, command failures, and API failures are handled in the current
process. `SIGKILL`, Pod eviction, node loss, and host loss are reconciled by a
later lifecycle command.

An error never becomes a durable `ERROR`, `UNKNOWN`, or `AMBIGUOUS` lifecycle
state. Those are observations, not proven attempt facts. The command retains
the last proven state, exits nonzero, and reports the uncertainty.

## State machines

The lifecycle comprises three authoritative state machines. Kubernetes Job
state is corroborating evidence, not a fourth source of lifecycle truth.

### Local attempt lifecycle

The local metadata controls which CLI operations may mutate an attempt:

```text
new -> PREPARED -> SUBMITTED -> TERMINAL -> COLLECTION_IN_PROGRESS -> COLLECTED
          |             |
          |             `-> CANCEL_REQUESTED -> TERMINAL
          `-> SUBMISSION_FAILED
```

The complete legal transition set is:

```text
new -> PREPARED
PREPARED -> SUBMITTED
PREPARED -> SUBMISSION_FAILED
SUBMITTED -> CANCEL_REQUESTED
SUBMITTED -> TERMINAL
CANCEL_REQUESTED -> TERMINAL
TERMINAL -> COLLECTION_IN_PROGRESS
COLLECTION_IN_PROGRESS -> COLLECTED
```

No transition leaves `COLLECTED` or `SUBMISSION_FAILED`. Resume creates a new
attempt; it never reopens its predecessor. Local `TERMINAL` means that the
remote outcome is durably terminal and measured I/O has ended. The exact Job
must additionally be terminal or verified absent before collection may
publish or remove remote state.

### PVC run lifecycle

The PVC is authoritative for benchmark progress until collection:

```text
PREPARED -> RUNNING -> SUCCESS
    |          |
    |          `----> FAILED
    `---------------> CANCELLED
```

`PREPARED` may also become `FAILED`; `RUNNING` may become `CANCELLED`.
`SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, and `CANCELLED` are immutable terminal outcomes. Recovery
may reconstruct a missing terminal summary or publication manifest from a
consistent ledger, but may not change one terminal outcome into another.

### Per-cell lifecycle

Each reified execution has this lifecycle:

```text
PENDING -> RUNNING -> SUCCESS
                  `-> FAILED
```

A cell never returns to `PENDING` within an attempt. Coordinator loss while a
cell is `RUNNING` turns it into a collectible failure; later cells remain
`PENDING`. Resume creates another attempt containing the cells that did not
succeed. Collected successful cells and their results remain immutable.

### Kubernetes Job evidence

The exact Job may be observed as:

```text
NOT_CREATED, CREATE_AMBIGUOUS, ACTIVE, COMPLETE, FAILED, or DELETED
```

Only the saved kind, name, namespace, UID, ownership nonce, and attempt labels
establish identity. A broad label query never establishes ownership. A failed
or externally deleted exact Job with a nonterminal PVC ledger is bounded
coordinator-loss evidence: a lifecycle command may recover the run to a
collectible failure when the saved identity and durable control state agree.

### Public status projection

| Local state | Public status behavior |
|---|---|
| `PREPARED` | Report `PREPARED`, or reconcile a provably failed submission to `SUBMISSION_FAILED`. |
| `SUBMISSION_FAILED` | Report `SUBMISSION_FAILED`. |
| `SUBMITTED` | Report the validated PVC state: `PREPARED`, `RUNNING`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, or `CANCELLED`. |
| `CANCEL_REQUESTED` | Report pending cancellation and direct the user to retry `--cancel`. |
| `TERMINAL` | Report the validated terminal PVC outcome. |
| `COLLECTION_IN_PROGRESS` | Report the terminal outcome and resumable collection context. |
| `COLLECTED` | Report the locally verified terminal outcome without cluster access. |

Identity, authentication, query, and consistency failures return nonzero
instead of inventing another state value.

## Invariants

1. Attempt ID, ownership nonce, namespace/PV/PVC identity, configuration,
   image, workload identity, and execution definitions are immutable.
2. One attempt is current per result tree. The current pointer is atomic;
   historical attempt metadata remains immutable.
3. One mutating lifecycle command may operate on a result tree. Concurrent
   commands are rejected rather than queued.
4. One active sweep may own the configured PVC. Its global reservation is
   never stolen.
5. Every external create follows `durable intent -> create -> exact identity
   observation -> durable UID journal -> intent removal`.
6. Destructive operations require exact kind, name, namespace, UID, ownership
   nonce, and attempt identity. Operational lookup failure is not absence.
7. `PREPARED` may contain partial resources, but every possible resource is
   represented by a creation intent or exact resource journal.
8. `SUBMITTED` has an exact UID-journaled sweep Job.
9. The PVC coordinator lock gives one Job Pod authority to mutate the ledger;
   duplicate Job Pods exit first.
10. Node UID, architecture, resolved image identity, and Pod IPv4 address are
    frozen. A worker Pod name or UID may change only when the same Node and IP
    remain healthy; all other drift fails rather than retargeting the attempt.
11. A cell commits only when its artifacts, exit code, terminal cell state,
    summary, and publication manifest agree.
12. Scratch-to-PVC result publication never overlaps measured benchmark I/O.
13. A terminal run is collectible only when its ledger, summary, publication
    manifest, and exact Job quiescence agree.
14. Remote cleanup begins only after the complete local publication verifies.
15. `COLLECTED` means the local publication verifies, the remote run and PVC
    lock are gone, exact owned resources are gone, and no benchmark work remains.
16. Resume never reruns a collected successful cell.
17. Traversing, linked, contradictory, corrupt, or identity-mismatched state
    fails closed.
18. Supplemental diagnostic failure does not block safe cleanup or replace the
    primary error.

## Linearization points

| Operation | Linearization point |
|---|---|
| Attempt identity exists | Atomic rename of the complete attempt metadata directory. |
| Attempt becomes current and recoverable | Atomic replacement of `current-attempt` before external mutation. |
| Local transition | Atomic replacement of `state.sh`. |
| PVC ownership | Same-filesystem rename of an initialized pending lock directory to the canonical lock. |
| A Kubernetes resource may exist | Creation intent is durable before `kubectl create`. |
| Kubernetes ownership is locally established | Exact UID-bearing resource journal is atomically published. |
| Submission succeeds | Exact Job UID is journaled and local state becomes `SUBMITTED`. |
| Coordinator ownership | Atomic creation of `coordinator.lock`; owner-file completion is recoverable initialization. |
| Run becomes active | Atomic `run.status=RUNNING` after bundle, snapshots, ledger, and service validation. |
| Cell begins | Atomic `NNNN.status=RUNNING`. |
| Cell commits | Atomic replacement of the publication manifest after artifacts, exit code, terminal cell status, and summary. |
| Run commits its outcome | Terminal summary and status plus a consistent publication manifest. |
| Cancellation begins | `SUBMITTED -> CANCEL_REQUESTED` before exact Job deletion. |
| Collection publication begins | `TERMINAL -> COLLECTION_IN_PROGRESS` after bounded archive receipt and before extraction or result publication. The unpublished archive may exist while local state remains `TERMINAL`. |
| Local import checkpoint | Verified state is atomically installed as `collected-state` after result merging. |
| Collection completes | Remote and resource cleanup completes, then local state becomes `COLLECTED`. |
| Resume succeeds | A new attempt becomes current under compare-and-swap against the collected predecessor. |

## Fault matrix

`Covered` means implementation and focused regression evidence exist.
`Acceptance pending` means local and kind coverage exists but the named
external environment must still be exercised. A future change that weakens a
covered row is a regression. Faults outside this matrix require an explicit
contract change rather than silently expanding the release boundary.

### Submission

| Fault boundary | Class | Required result | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invalid configuration, path, PVC, selector, identity, or image | Required recovery | Reject before mutation and identify the field. | Covered |

| Client credentials expired | Required recovery | Report authentication and direct the user to reauthenticate and retry. | Covered; external acceptance pending |

### Regression evidence map

The matrix is enforced at the following layers. A `Covered` label requires an
assertion at the appropriate layer; merely reaching the branch is not evidence.

| Production credential, CNI, and RWX acceptance | The dated external acceptance record described below; still pending |

Real tests validate cross-component behavior without reproducing every fast
branch. A matrix row may say `Covered` only while a focused assertion exercises
its decision boundary; new rows must add named evidence. Unsupported rows need
detection tests where the condition can be created safely, not recovery tests.

## Diagnostic contract

Every failure at a supported matrix boundary must identify, when known:

```text
operation, phase, attempt ID, last proven local state,
last proven remote state, exact Job evidence, normalized reason,
resource kind/name/namespace, expected and observed UID,
local and remote state paths, whether work may still be running,
and the next safe action
```

Normalized reasons are `AUTH`, `TIMEOUT`, `API_THROTTLED`,
`API_UNAVAILABLE`, `IDENTITY_MISMATCH`, `POD_UNSCHEDULABLE`, `IMAGE_PULL`,
`PVC_MOUNT`, `PVC_IO`, `ENOSPC`, `LOCAL_IO`, `ARCHIVE_INVALID`,
`LEDGER_INCONSISTENT`, `OWNERSHIP_AMBIGUOUS`, and
`CANCELLATION_INCOMPLETE`.

For required-recovery faults, capture bounded Job, Pod, and DaemonSet
descriptions; relevant container logs and namespace events; durable PVC state;
the publication manifest; and exact retained resource identities. Store the
schema-versioned, bounded diagnostic bundle in the attempt's local Kubernetes
metadata, not in
the benchmark result/reporting contract. If diagnostic capture fails, retain
the primary error, continue safe cleanup, print copy-pasteable inspection
commands, and state whether data and resources were retained.

## Unsupported situations

The initial contract explicitly excludes:

- cooperative execution of concurrent mutating lifecycle commands;
- more than one active sweep on one PVC;
- automatic retry of a failed cell within the same attempt;
- transparent worker, endpoint, node, architecture, or image retargeting;
- automatic Kubernetes credential renewal or Teleport login;
- preservation of active-cell `emptyDir` scratch after hard Pod or node loss;
- automatic adoption after API-create visibility exceeds the ambiguity horizon;
- reconstruction after local attempt metadata loss or corruption;
- recovery after permanent PVC loss or corruption;
- recovery after namespace, PV, or PVC UID replacement;
- power-loss durability beyond the atomic-rename guarantees of the filesystems;
- malicious mutation of trusted local snapshots or PVC state;
- a compromised administrator, CNI, admission controller, service mesh, or
  storage driver that violates validated prerequisites;
- IPv6-only networking, heterogeneous selected architectures, set-based node
  selectors, and Kubernetes delete-only.

Unsupported does not mean silent. Detectable violations fail closed and name
the violated prerequisite or invariant.

## External credential-expiry acceptance

Run this gate on a representative Teleport-mediated cluster using its real RWX
claim. It cannot be replaced by kind or fake-`kubectl` coverage.

1. Record cluster, namespace, PV, and PVC UIDs and the active Teleport session
   expiry. Preserve the invocation, tool version, image digest, and node/CNI
   facts with the test evidence.
2. Submit `baseline`, wait for durable `RUNNING`, and let the original client
   credential expire without touching the Job.
3. Prove the Job continues and reaches a durable terminal state while the
   submitting shell can no longer query the API.
4. From the expired shell, run status and collection. Require `AUTH`, the saved
   attempt identity, `may_still_be_running=unknown`, and an exact
   reauthentication-and-retry action; neither command may mutate local or
   remote state.
5. Reauthenticate in a new shell, rerun status and collection, validate the
   ordinary result/report contract, and prove exact resource cleanup.
6. Repeat credential expiry during a running cancellation and during archive
   collection. Reauthenticate and prove that repeated `--cancel` and
   `--collect` finish the journaled operations without unrelated deletion or
   retransferring verified publication.
7. Run `failure-resume`, `kubectl-cancel`, and
   `kubectl-coordinator-loss`; require the same recovery semantics established
   by the real fixture.
8. Point the saved results directory at credentials for a different cluster
   exposing the same object names. Namespace/PV/PVC UID validation must reject
   it before mutation.
9. Confirm that no namespace, PV, PVC, unrelated workload, retained benchmark
   dataset, or unrelated NetworkPolicy was changed.

Record this gate by date and environment in the release or PR evidence. Do not
claim the external acceptance criterion from simulated token expiry alone.

## Closure criteria

Lifecycle hardening is complete when:

1. The three authoritative state machines and exact transitions above are
   normative.
2. Fast tests execute every legal local edge and reject every other state pair.
3. The fault boundaries in this matrix are frozen.
4. Every required-recovery row has named before/after fault evidence proving no false
   success, unrelated deletion, hidden active attempt, or unrecoverable retry
   state, and proving eventual completion or collectible failure.
5. Every required-diagnosis row verifies its normalized reason and next action.
6. Real fixtures cover baseline, benchmark failure/resume, cancel, coordinator
   loss, endpoint drift, and interrupted collection.
7. External acceptance covers real credential expiry and the representative
   CNI/RWX environment.
8. No open defect violates an invariant or supported matrix row.
9. One final adversarial review is performed against this frozen contract.

Findings outside this contract become backlog or explicit design proposals;
they do not silently extend the release boundary.

As of 2026-09-26, repository-controlled criteria 1–6 and 8 have focused test
evidence, and the complete Docker SBX lifecycle passes every SSH, Slurm, and
kubectl scenario. Criterion 7 remains pending because it requires the real
Teleport-mediated CNI/RWX environment described above. Criterion 9 remains the
final release review after that external evidence is recorded.
