## Project boundary

NVIDIA Storage Scale Test is Bash and Python tooling for distributed storage
benchmarks. It covers:

- filesystem data IO with elbencho;
- filesystem metadata create/stat/delete with elbencho;
- S3-compatible object storage with Warp and an in-tree s3test connectivity
  utility; and
- storage-network traffic with elbencho netbench.

The lowercase repository, package, tarball, and directory identifier is
`storage-scale-test`. Shell configuration uses `SCALE_TEST_BASE` as the
repository or extracted deployment root.

Elbencho and Warp run as separate third-party processes. Their source and
binaries are not vendored in the repository. The repository publishes source
only: NVIDIA and the project do not publish or deliver benchmark binaries or
prepared deployment tarballs. Users may create a deployment tarball locally
and are responsible for every binary they place in it.

`EXECUTION_SUBSTRATE` explicitly selects Slurm, passwordless SSH, or kubectl;
there is no default, and `SSH_HOST_LIST` no longer selects a mode. The
benchmark processes require Linux; macOS with Homebrew Bash and coreutils may
initiate SSH or kubectl sweeps. Kubectl also requires Homebrew GNU tar and
`flock`; validation checks the prefixed commands before touching the cluster.
The `integration-tests/` fixture provisions three kind nodes, RWX storage, two
SSH workers, Slinky Slurm, and the Kubernetes sweep prerequisites. Its `nfs`
backend uses loop-backed NFSv4 and NFS CSI; `sbx-shared` uses static volumes
over a repository-shared path. NFS retains pinned Kindnet; Docker SBX uses
pinned, preloaded Calico because its nested kernel cannot run Kindnet's
nftables policy path. Setup proves non-root Elbencho Pod placement, direct
Pod-IPv4 coordination, enforced NetworkPolicy, and PVC access before testing
the SSH, Slurm, and kubectl substrates.

One budget drives PVC capacity and the growable 4 GiB NFS image. Setup publishes
image tags transactionally, grows retained filesystems, checks fixture and Docker
backing capacity, and reconciles eight NFS workers. Teardown restores recorded
NFS active, enabled, and worker-count states. SBX pins kind 0.30 and
Kubernetes/kubectl 1.34; setup replaces clusters whose kubelets do not match the
node-image profile.

Lifecycle actions run as an ordinary user, store state under
`tmp/integration-state`, and use `sudo` only for NFS host operations. Ownership
markers protect dedicated state and export leaves. A symlink-safe root-owned
global lock and owner record protect fixed NFS configuration. Cached upstream
images must match their pinned digest and runner architecture. NFS CSI misses try
`registry.k8s.io` and `gcr.io/k8s-staging-sig-storage`; its chart tags exist only
inside kind. Kind node and other image misses use bounded host-Docker retries.
The SBX binary-extraction path shares those verified image acquisitions. Setup
acquires all Slinky OCI charts before installing releases, caching validated
archives with source/version/checksum manifests. Image and chart pulls retry only
recognized transient failures, with exponential backoff, jitter, and a four-minute
deadline. Sanitized errors and retry history remain in setup logs; authentication,
corruption, and unknown failures remain fatal.
Interrupted private aliases are reconciled; MariaDB and Slinky's Alpine helpers
use preloaded fixture-private tags. Cleanup recovers partial bootstrap, removes
only owned resources, restores prior NFS state, verifies unmounts, and does not
depend on writable diagnostics. NFS headroom uses a configurable floor of 32
workers without lowering existing capacity; tuning and restoration are
best-effort. First-stall diagnostics capture kernel/NFS evidence locally,
and blocked server workers trigger a bounded pool increase. Docker SBX avoids
NFS; true NFS kernel isolation needs a separate server VM or host.

The test CLI selects substrates and scenarios independently. Its planner batches
shared-home SSH cases behind a crash-recoverable transition; separate homes are
canonical. Pod work uses `tester` UID/GID 2000, matching the all-squashed NFS
export and Slurm account.
Restart the Slinky login Pod, not its operator-managed Deployment template;
the operator can revert rollout annotations and kill an in-flight probe.

The harness builds the ordinary deployment archive from an immutable tracked
snapshot, caches it by snapshot, architecture, fixed recipe, and seeded
Elbencho/runtime identity, and extracts isolated scenario workspaces. Real cases
cover baseline and default I/O, failure/resume, retained data, live capture,
Cartesian sweeps, single-file and weighted-root behavior, shared SSH homes, and
Slurm scheduling. Fast tests cover parsing, precedence, path and workload safety,
sizing, scheduler boundaries, failure contracts, and reporting. On-demand CI
runs the full NFS-backed catalog concurrently on amd64 and arm64 with
repeatable-teardown headroom; SBX is a supported local backend. Integration CI
installs runtime requirements into `.venv` and uses that interpreter for both
startup smoke checks and the lifecycle; `.venv-ci` is not a runtime bootstrap.

The kubectl filesystem sweep's implemented decisions and tradeoffs are retained
in the historical
[design record](plans/kubernetes-elbencho-filesystem-sweep.md). Its normative
state machines, invariants, fault matrix, and unsupported cases are frozen in
[KUBERNETES_ELBENCHO_LIFECYCLE.md](KUBERNETES_ELBENCHO_LIFECYCLE.md).
Attempts publish their local `PREPARED` pointer before external mutation so an
interrupted setup remains recoverable; resume uses compare-and-swap against the
collected predecessor. Collection waits for the exact journaled Job to
become inactive, uses one transfer deadline with bounded transient-only retries,
and retains bounded transfer stderr and exit history even after recovery.
Only published state is transferred, not uploaded control files. An isolated tar
changed-source warning retries from scratch; manifest hashes still gate import.
Unknown remote errors are not diagnosed as API outages. It recovers coordinator loss
from either PREPARED or RUNNING. Derived workload paths are resolved against
live PVC symlinks, and endpoint checks freeze Node, Pod, address, architecture,
and image identity. Ordinary PVC commands detach stdin; only finite bundle
uploads use interactive `kubectl exec`. Successful status queries return zero
regardless of the recorded benchmark outcome. Preparation distinguishes local,
capacity, path, API, and PVC failures; bounded diagnostics retain Pod details,
PVC ledger/publication evidence, and exact resource identities.
Elbencho validation, worker, and coordinator Pods use `Unconfined` seccomp for
Linux AIO; non-benchmark helpers retain `RuntimeDefault`.

GitHub Actions runs concurrent compliance, ShellCheck, Black, and Pylint checks
alongside Python 3.12 unit tests for pull requests and pushes to `main`. Python
3.14 unit tests run weekly and on manual request.

## Configuration and substrate selection

Users copy `env.sh.template` to `env.sh`. Test entry points source `env.sh`,
which sources `lib/env_base.sh`; entry points also source the shared functions
they need. `validate_env.sh` checks the resolved configuration before expensive
work begins.

Important configuration relationships:

- `EXECUTION_SUBSTRATE` is required and derives exactly one mode flag. `ssh`
  also requires `SSH_HOST_LIST`; that file accepts comma- or whitespace-separated
  hosts and ignores comment lines. Kubectl is supported by the filesystem IO
  and metadata sweeps; object and network entry points remain SSH/Slurm-only.
- In Slurm mode, `SLURM_NODE_INCLUDES`
  and `SLURM_NODE_IGNORES` point to optional files containing valid Slurm
  hostlists, including compressed forms.
- `ORDER_NODES=1` makes SSH selection use the first requested hosts. With a
  Slurm include list, it makes jobs use the first requested expanded nodes.
  Netbench still shuffles its selected nodes when forming traffic groups.
- `SLURM_EXCLUSIVE_USER=1` selects `--exclusive=user`. Because that mode does
  not imply all CPUs, setup queries the target node CPU count and adds
  `--cpus-per-task` when it can resolve the count. The default is bare
  `--exclusive`.
- `_SBATCH_OPTIONS_BASE` and `_SRUN_OPTIONS_BASE` contain the structured base
  options. `build_sbatch_cmd` and `build_srun_cmd` append the
  `SLURM_EXTRA_ARGS` array without losing embedded spaces. The public
  `SBATCH_OPTIONS` and `SRUN_OPTIONS` strings include flattened extra arguments
  for best-effort interactive use.
- `parse_range_specification()` accepts comma-separated values, ascending
  inclusive ranges, and `+step` increments. Entry points validate the complete
  expanded list before dispatch.
- `TEST_DIRS` is an associative array of filesystem test roots and weights.
  `validate_env.sh` compares each path's `stat -c %d` device number with `/`
  through both dispatch interfaces; this establishes distinct backing storage,
  not that the configured path is itself the exact mountpoint.
  Object tests use a dedicated `OBJ_BUCKET`, endpoint settings, and credentials
  sourced from `OBJ_AUTH_FILE`.

`env.sh`, `OBJ_AUTH_FILE`, filesystem resume snapshots, and reified execution
definitions are sourced as Bash. They are executable trusted inputs, not passive
configuration data.

## Execution architecture

### Shared benchmark logic

Slurm and SSH wrappers establish a node context and call the same benchmark
functions from `lib/_elbencho_functions.sh`, `lib/_warp_functions.sh`, or
`lib/_netbench_functions.sh`. Sourced libraries use caller-provided variables;
their ShellCheck annotations document that boundary.

SSH nodes do not need the repository or results filesystem mounted. The launch
host copies the required binary and libraries into a remote working directory,
then sends Bash through `ssh host /bin/bash -s`. Metadata, object, network, and
filesystem delete-only operations use checked-in remote scriptlets. Filesystem
IO sweep cells build an inline scriptlet from a saved execution definition and
an SSH-specific tail. Results return as a compressed `tar | tar` stream.

### Filesystem IO reification and resume

`nv-elbencho-sweep.sh` expands the Cartesian product of node counts, IO-size
entries, thread counts, and IO depths before dispatch. Each cell has stable,
1-indexed files under `OUTPUT_DIR/executions/`:

- `NNNN.sh`: sourceable parameters and generated paths;
- `NNNN.status`: atomically written `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, `SUCCESS`, or `FAILED`;
- `NNNN.log`: cell output;
- `NNNN.exitcode`: command status; and
- `NNNN.jobid`: Slurm coordinator job ID when applicable.

Each cell receives a stable `-${DS}-e${execution_id}` test-path suffix. Retries
therefore reuse that cell's paths without colliding with another cell.

In Slurm mode, `dispatch_slurm_executions` allocates the largest node count
needed by any non-successful cell and submits
`storage-tests/fs/sbatch/_nv-elbencho-coordinator.sh`. The coordinator starts
elbencho services once across the allocation and processes cells sequentially,
using the first requested number of allocation hosts for each cell. Initial
service health failure preserves its log and gets one bounded restart attempt;
phase-level checks can also restart unhealthy services. Signals cancel and
wait for the exact allocation before restoring the caller's traps. Cancellation
is armed immediately after submission, before dispatch-lock handoff; an
unverified cancellation retains the lock.

In SSH mode, `dispatch_ssh_executions` starts services once across the usable
host pool. It selects a fresh host subset for each cell, runs cells sequentially,
and retrieves that cell's artifacts before continuing.

Both modes stop after the first failed cell. `--resume <results_dir>` is mutually
exclusive with other CLI modes, sources the saved `env_used.sh`, resets stale
`RUNNING` cells to `PENDING`, skips `SUCCESS`, and runs the rest in order. A
dispatch lock prevents concurrent coordinators or resume loops from operating
on the same execution directory. Slurm resume refuses to reset work while the
saved coordinator may still be active; if `squeue` no longer knows the job,
terminal state must be confirmed through Slurm accounting.

`env_used.sh` is the executable resume snapshot. `env_used.yaml` is the
human- and tool-readable run snapshot. Protect the result directory from
untrusted modification because resume sources both `env_used.sh` and each
`executions/NNNN.sh`.

In kubectl mode, one submission represents the whole sweep. The launcher
acquires a PVC-wide Kubernetes Lease, stages a verified control bundle below
the lexically first normalized `TEST_DIRS` root, freezes worker Pod addresses,
starts one Elbencho service Pod per worker, and creates one coordinator Job.
The Job needs no API credentials after startup. `--status`, `--cancel`, and
`--collect` operate on that attempt; collection releases the Lease last, and
recovers its final delete-to-journal interruption only after proving publication
and all preceding exact cleanup. `--resume` creates a new attempt after
collection while preserving successful cells.

Kubernetes uses ordinary Pod networking and attempt-scoped NetworkPolicy,
not host networking, host ports, or Services. Worker endpoint identity is
revalidated by status and collection; the API-independent coordinator probes
frozen addresses before each cell. Drift or coordinator loss is recovered only
with fresh identity evidence. Collection copies PVC results to the local result
tree. A configured namespace, existing PV/PVC, node selector, authorized kubectl
context, and compatible CNI are prerequisites. Control uploads verify private
staging archives before publishing and retry only transient failures, reconciling
lost acknowledgements against the existing immutable controls. Coordinator
health probes retry the same selected address three times without replaying
measured work. Collection reserves per-transfer recovery time within its total
deadline; partial archives are discarded and publication hashes remain mandatory.
Docker SBX validates the supported kind profile; dual-architecture NFS CI and
a separately authorized external-cluster run are release acceptance gates.

## Filesystem IO workload models

All filesystem IO models use the same reified sweep and result layout, but
their termination and cleanup contracts differ.

### Worker directories

`ELBENCHO_FILE_LAYOUT=worker-directories` is the default many-file workload.
Directory creation is separate. In worker-directory layout, one root with
weight 1 and direct IO uses timed writes and reads by default. Buffered IO,
multiple distinct roots, and
`--run-to-completion` select completion mode for both phases: each requested
phase processes its finite dataset without a benchmark time limit or repetition.
A sole `TEST_DIRS` root must have weight 1. Explicit `ELBENCHO_FILES_PER_NODE`
is a per-node budget rounded to the nearest multiple of threads times summed
weights (ties upward, minimum one file per thread per weighted target). Without
an explicit count, the FS budgets and duration derive automatic counts; in
completion mode duration sizes the dataset rather than limiting runtime. The
effective mode is saved with execution coordinates; its reason is printed
during initial staging. Resume preserves the recorded semantics rather than
reinterpreting the request.

Unless `ELBENCHO_FILE_SIZE` is set, generated file size is the write block size
times `ELBENCHO_FILE_SIZE_MULTIPLIER`.

The entry point supports these lifecycle modes:

- default: mkdir, write, optional pause, read, cleanup;
- `--write-only`: mkdir and write, retain each cell's dataset, and print
  `ELBENCHO_WRITE_ONLY_DATA_DIR`;
- `--write-no-read`: mkdir, write, cleanup;
- `--read-from <directory>`: read an operator-provided dataset using a scanned
  or cached treefile; and
- `--delete-only <directory>`: delete once on one compute node after validating
  that the path is a strict descendant of the configured test root.

A directory staged with `--read-from` may contain
`.storage-scale-test-elbencho-treefile.txt`. A cache miss scans into a temporary
file in the dataset parent and publishes it atomically only after a successful
read; later reads reuse it without rescanning. The operator must remove the cache
after changing the dataset. Direct IO staged directory reads are time-limited
by default; buffered IO or `--run-to-completion` reads the scanned dataset to
completion. Totals come from the exact treefile rather than the current reader
topology or `ELBENCHO_FILES_PER_NODE`.

### Generated shared directory

`ELBENCHO_FILE_LAYOUT=shared-directory` models a bounded checkpoint-like
dataset in one flat shared directory. It requires one `TEST_DIRS` root with
weight 1 and a positive `ELBENCHO_FILES_PER_NODE`. Each configured thread count
must divide files per node exactly:

```text
files_per_worker = ELBENCHO_FILES_PER_NODE / threads
total_files = nodes * ELBENCHO_FILES_PER_NODE
```

Each worker owns complete files. IO depth controls outstanding block IO; it does
not create extra writers or file descriptors for one file. Multiple workers
sharing a single file are not represented by this layout.

`ELBENCHO_FILE_SIZE` sets the exact per-file size; otherwise the write block size
and multiplier derive it. Direct or random IO requires exact divisibility by
the effective block size. Buffered sequential IO may finish with a short final
block.

Generated mkdir, write, read, and distributed `RMFILES` phases are finite
exact-completion operations: they do not use `--timelimit` or `--infloop`.
Mkdir must exit successfully, and write/read JSON must report the expected file
and byte counts before the cell can advance or succeed. Delete JSON must report
the expected entry count and last-worker elapsed time. After distributed
deletion, the runner verifies the target identity and removes the empty
directory with `rmdir`; recursive removal is reserved for identity-checked
failure and signal cleanup.

Per-cell `NNNN.write.json`, `NNNN.read.json`, `NNNN.delete.json`, and atomic
`NNNN.workload.tsv` files preserve completion and timing evidence. Default runs
remove the proven-empty generated target after read. `--write-only` retains it;
`--write-no-read` performs the verified distributed deletion. Controlled
failure retains the original error even if best-effort cleanup also has a
problem.

### One shared large file

`ELBENCHO_SINGLE_BIG_FILE=1` selects regular-file path mode and permits only
sequential IO. Generated write/default runs require
`ELBENCHO_SINGLE_BIG_FILE_SIZE` and process one exact extent. Elbencho normally
partitions that file among services; `ELBENCHO_ALL_NODES_ACCESS_ALL_DATA=1`
adds `--nosvcshare` so each node accesses the complete file.

`--read-from <file>` takes the extent from file metadata, without a treescan.
By default, direct reads repeat until the time limit. Buffered IO or
`--run-to-completion` reads the file extent without a time limit or repetition.

### IO-size and cache semantics

IO-size entries encode both transfer size and access order:

- `4K`: sequential 4 KiB write and read;
- `r4K`: random 4 KiB write and read; and
- `1M,r4K`: sequential 1 MiB write followed by random 4 KiB read.

Multi-node reads rotate the host list between phases and reified cells so a
reader does not retain the same writer-to-file or writer-to-slice assignment.
This reduces client-cache reuse but does not replace direct IO when page-cache
effects are outside the intended workload.

All phases for one cell append to one CSV. The first emitted phase writes the
header and later phases use `--nocsvlabels`. Read-only runs write a header.
`extract-elbencho.py` also recognizes headerless elbencho CSV by locating the
operation column and using the upstream CSV field offsets; this compatibility
path derives direct/random flags from the command field when needed.

## Other benchmark contracts

### Filesystem metadata

`nv-mdtest-elbencho.sh` runs separate create, stat, and delete elbencho
invocations for each iteration. Host assignment rotates between phases to
reduce client metadata-cache reuse. Files are zero length so the reported work
isolates metadata operations.

Metadata sweeps reify every `(nodes, tasks_per_node)` pair into the same
numbered execution ledger used by filesystem IO. Each definition records its
workload kind, parameters, and distinct generated target paths. SSH and Slurm
resume non-successful cells from `env_used.sh` while retaining successful
results; Kubernetes uses the asynchronous status/cancel/collect lifecycle and
requires collection before resume. The shared dispatch protocol accepts both
workload kinds. Prepared batches save ordered groups locally, freeze common
resources, and permanently seal their manifest before first external mutation.
Batch preflight validates each group's saved completion policy, not current
launcher settings.
One global ledger owns statuses; group snapshots and artifacts remain isolated
through dispatch, collection, resume, and unified filesystem reporting.
The Kubernetes parent owns each active cell's group-specific scratch path and
finalizes abnormal child exits before publishing a terminal attempt.
Reporters share option definitions; the unified entry point routes by workload
kind and retains other groups' index links across filtered runs only when
their canonical batch, immutable group, and report-content identity match.
Kubernetes helper loading is idempotent: repeated preflight/dispatch loads must
preserve readonly constants and active ownership maps.
Status emits one scoped progress view with collection state and next action.
Kubernetes counts its current attempt from the PVC until local publication;
zero running cells do not imply terminality or collection readiness.
Because elbencho appends to existing result files, a metadata retry removes
all per-iteration `.out`/`.csv` pairs before target preparation. Every
substrate requires nonempty, nonsymlink result pairs and an atomic completion
marker written after all phases and cleanup before marking a cell successful.
The analyzer includes only `SUCCESS` cells when a reified metadata ledger is
present, including through symlinked input paths; legacy result directories
remain readable without a ledger.
Result discovery pairs CSV and OUT files within one input directory and skips
duplicate logical results across directories, so data from separate runs
cannot be combined silently.
Metadata cells set their execution ID and scratch directory so core dumps are
saved and attributed consistently across all three substrates.

The default layout pre-creates a wide branched tree and gives each thread
`MDTEST_BRANCH_FACTOR²` directories. `--single-dir-file-target <count>` instead
uses elbencho `-n 0`, placing uniquely named worker files directly in one flat
directory. Dense mode requires one node count, one task count, and one generated
target. Elbencho assigns a uniform integer file count to every worker, so the
actual total is the closest whole-worker multiple with at least one file per
worker. Both requested and actual values are recorded.

The analyzer aggregates a result pair only when its CSV contains complete
`WRITE`, `STAT`, and `RMFILES` records and its `.out` file contains all three
latency histograms. It reports rates, last-worker phase elapsed times,
percentiles, variance, scaling efficiency, and configuration provenance across
iterations. Conflicting provenance values are displayed together with a
warning rather than silently selecting one.
Metadata histogram buckets may be decimal microseconds; CSV-cache import
restores numeric bucket keys before plotting and rejects colliding keys. Raw
Elbencho histograms sum repeated buckets so observations are preserved.

### Object storage

Warp histogram cache import rejects numeric bucket collisions in both overall
and per-client reports. Live Warp histograms sum repeated buckets before
serialization so duplicate observations retain their counts.

`nv-warp-sweep.sh` performs bucket cleanup, PUT until the configured aggregate
minimum object count, a GET sweep over thread counts, and final DELETE cleanup
for each node-count/object-size configuration. `WARP_PUT_MIN_FILES_PER_CLIENT`
is multiplied by node count. The bucket is destructive benchmark state and
must contain no valuable objects.

Optional behavior includes multipart uploads, ranged reads, S3 Express endpoint
handling, aggregate PUT/GET RPS budgets, and `WARP_PREFIXES`. Static prefixes
require support from the NVIDIA Warp fork at
`https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp-minio`; Warp deletes its objects but does not
perform a separate operation to remove the logical prefixes represented by
their names.

The Warp analyzer prefers JSON or JSON.zst but can parse text output. It treats
request segments as optional/partial, supports both `single_sized_requests` and
`multi_sized_requests`, and combines multi-size TTFB histograms using Warp's
stored sums and squared sums before recomputing aggregate percentiles. Its
analyzed-JSON envelope is recognized by content rather than filename. Optional
per-client plots and reports cover fairness, persistent underperformance, and
segment-level behavior for multi-client runs.

### Network

Network testing is beta and needs more work before at-scale use.
`nv-netbench.sh` splits selected nodes into groups A and B and uses elbencho
netbench without localhost traffic. The default half-and-half mode runs A→B and
B→A sequentially. `--bidirectional` starts two services per node on adjacent
ports and drives both directions concurrently with separate coordinators.

Per-thread transfer size is inversely proportional to thread count so a
saturated NIC should run for approximately `NETBENCH_TARGET_RUNTIME`. Group
assignments shuffle between iterations to reduce topology bias. The analyzer
combines iterations and directions, reporting Gbps/Tbps throughput,
latency percentiles, scaling efficiency, and log-scale histograms.

Pairwise-all traffic is not implemented. Elbencho netbench has no native
timeout, so external execution limits remain an operator concern.

## Results and analysis

Runs write UTC-datestamped directories below `RESULTS_DIR`, including
`elbencho-<datestamp>`, `mdtest-elbencho-<datestamp>`,
`warp-<datestamp>`, and `netbench-<mode>-<datestamp>`.

The analysis wrappers call `setup_python_venv()` and install the pinned root
`requirements.txt` only when its hash differs from
`.venv/.requirements.sha256`. Python 3.12 or newer is required; pinned NumPy
sets that floor. Run analyzers through their shell wrappers so dependency setup
and argument forwarding remain consistent.

Shared Python behavior lives in `lib/`:

- `reporting_common.py`: result-pair discovery, histogram parsing, latency
  formatting, scale filters, shared CLI flags, and histogram axis bounds;
- `env_used_yaml.py`: environment snapshot loading and application;
- `join_datestamps.py`: display and filename-safe datestamp joining;
- `parse_only_sizes.py`: `--only-sizes` parsing without splitting compound
  entries such as `1M,r64K`;
- `stdout_report_file.py`: mirrored terminal report output; and
- `elbencho_live_report.py`: live CSV aggregation and per-client analysis.

Reports preserve operation, size, random/sequential order, direct/buffered IO,
node count, thread count, and IO depth as separate dimensions. Plot series use
precomputed key-to-color mappings so non-contiguous equivalent configurations
receive the same color. Palette and marker behavior is analyzer-specific:

- filesystem IO and Warp use `tableau-colorblind10` for up to 10 series,
  `tab20` for 11–20, and `cividis` above 20; both provide 12 markers;
- metadata plots cycle `tableau-colorblind10`, and multi-node rate plots cycle
  eight markers; and
- netbench plots cycle a fixed seven-color palette and use circle markers.

Highly populated plots can reuse colors or marker shapes. The project generates
comparisons and reports but does not automatically decide whether a performance
change is a regression.

For large JSON or JSON.zst inspection without printing complete datasets, use
`utils/compress_json_for_context.py`:

```bash
zstd -dc result.json.zst | python3 utils/compress_json_for_context.py
python3 utils/compress_json_for_context.py < result.json
```

## Deployment helpers and supply chain

`utils/build_tarball.sh` creates `storage-scale-test.tar.gz` for a user to move
into a benchmark environment. It:

- downloads pinned upstream elbencho `v3.1-11` static archives for x86_64 and
  aarch64 when needed and verifies architecture-specific SHA-256 values;
- builds stripped static s3test binaries from `utils/build/s3-test.c` when
  missing or stale; and
- includes existing Warp binaries but does not download or automatically build
  them, warning when an architecture is missing.

`utils/build/build_s3test_from_source.sh` tries suitable local compilers, Docker,
and Docker Buildx. Failure to produce one architecture warns and permits tarball
creation, but object testing on that architecture will be unavailable.

`utils/build/build_warp_from_source.sh` builds x86_64 and aarch64 Warp from a
GitHub/GitLab HTTPS or SSH URL plus a tag, branch, or commit. With no arguments,
it uses `https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp-minio` at `nv-main-oss`. It requires Go
1.26.5 or newer and tries an adequate local Go, Docker, or a user-local temporary
Go installation. User-supplied source requires both URL and ref. Version metadata
is injected into the resulting binaries.

These helpers are convenience tooling, not a project-operated binary supply
chain. Users own source and toolchain selection, provenance, vulnerability
assessment, licenses, source-offer obligations, SBOMs, and validation of the
deployment tarball they create.

## Security and trust model

The tool assumes an operator-controlled Slurm deployment or passwordless-SSH
fleet. It does not create an authorization boundary between mutually untrusted
users. Test filesystem paths and object buckets must be dedicated and
disposable.

No inbound connection from outside the cluster or trusted benchmark environment
is required. Administrators can enforce that boundary with firewalls, security
groups, or network policies. Inside the boundary:

- the launch host must reach SSH servers in SSH mode;
- elbencho and Warp workers open temporary benchmark listeners;
- coordinators connect to those listeners;
- bidirectional netbench uses two service ports and associated data ports; and
- object tests connect outward to the configured S3-compatible endpoint.

Benchmark listeners are not authentication boundaries and must not be exposed
to untrusted networks. Build helpers may make internet connections when fetching
source, toolchains, images, or upstream binaries.

`OBJ_AUTH_FILE` should be mode `0400`. SSH mode copies it under a restrictive
umask into the remote work area, where the Warp scriptlet sources it. Treat
remote work directories as credential-bearing and remove them according to the
operator's policy. SSH uses the user's existing key configuration; Slurm uses
the deployment's existing authentication.

Paths supplied to `--read-from` and `--delete-only` are trusted operator input.
Delete-only additionally enforces a strict descendant relationship to the
configured test root. Generated filesystem targets use identity checks before
recursive failure cleanup to avoid deleting an unrelated path.

Public accepted-risk records live in `.security-triage.yaml` and cover:

- operator-selected Warp source, Go toolchain, and build provenance;
- conventional S3 credential lengths;
- isolated ephemeral SSH fleets; and
- trusted resume directories as executable configuration.

## Development invariants

- Use elbencho behavior from source version 3.0.37 or newer when reasoning
  about CSV or execution semantics. Prefer a local `tmp/elbencho-src` checkout
  when present; `tmp/` is ignored and is not part of this repository.
- Do not vendor third-party benchmark code or binaries.
- Keep benchmark behavior shared between Slurm and SSH in `lib/`; substrate
  wrappers should establish context and transport, not fork core semantics.
- Keep filesystem exact-completion checks tied to explicit JSON counters and
  workload records. A zero elbencho exit status alone does not prove that a
  time-limited phase completed its intended finite dataset.
- Preserve write/read order separately for compound IO sizes. A single
  `random_io` value cannot describe `1M,r4K`.
- Build plot color mappings before plotting. Stateful color advancement fails
  when the same semantic key appears non-contiguously.
- Production duplication belongs in shared `lib/` modules. Repeated test setup
  belongs in a shared test helper.
- Every text file carries the NVIDIA Apache-2.0 header except `LICENSE`; the
  README header is intentionally at the bottom. See `AGENTS.md` for the exact
  rule.
- Shell tests use the adapters in `lib/_platform_functions.sh` to select
  unprefixed GNU coreutils on Linux and Homebrew's `g`-prefixed coreutils on
  macOS. Scale-test execution remains shell-only and does not acquire a Python
  dependency.

## Required validation

`pytest.ini` limits default collection to `tests/`, excluding ignored checkouts
under `tmp/`.

Run the repository checks from the root:

```bash
./utils/run_ci_checks.sh
```

The `lint` target runs the four static checks concurrently by default, buffers
their output, and reports all failures. `CI_CHECK_JOBS` controls the shared
concurrency budget. Local `all` runs divide the host's logical CPUs between the
lint checks and pytest, with pytest distributing tests through `pytest-xdist`.
Pull-request and `main` CI explicitly use four workers to match the runner CPU
count.

After Python changes, run Black 25.9.0 or newer and Pylint. `.pylintrc` is the
canonical configuration and the required score is 10.00/10. It gates Pylint's
enabled fatal/error/warning checks plus exactly these C/R checks:

- `C0200` (`consider-using-enumerate`)
- `C0411` (`wrong-import-order`)
- `R0801` (`duplicate-code`)
- `R1704` (`redefined-argument-from-local`)

All other C/R categories are disabled. `E0401` is disabled because dependency
availability is handled by wrapper setup and runtime validation; `W0511` allows
maintainer TODO/FIXME comments. `E0106` and `W1502` remain at Pylint's disabled
optional-extension defaults.

Shell changes must pass ShellCheck across the repository. Bash-specific
conditionals use `[[ ... ]]`; sourced libraries use `# shellcheck shell=bash`;
remote scriptlets use a Bash shebang; variables and arrays remain quoted; and
functions use explicit return status where the surrounding library follows that
convention.
