# Roadmap Items (last updated 2026-09-23)

## Completed

- Add kubectl as the filesystem Elbencho execution substrate. It uses an
  existing authorized cluster, namespace, and bound RWX PVC; submits a
  durable asynchronous sweep, and supports status, cancel, collect, and
  collection-gated resume.

## P0

- Integrate with AI Cloud Validation
(https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-cloud-validation).
    - Exercise the implemented kubectl substrate in the validation suite.
    - Add sweep across multiple storage targets.
    - Allow accumulation of different "sweep" executions that all get
      executed by an orchestrator process with resume capability.
    - Watch out for (current) 10m AI Cloud Validation test timeout--figure
      out the appropriate enhancement for that test suite to allow storage
      tests that may take some time to complete.
- High-scale timing-workers to facilitate at-scale resilience testing.

## P1

- Many-uid high-scale metadata load driving (probe for LDAP integration
  scaling issues on NFS systems).
- Add storage fault-injection tests to AI Cloud Validation.

## P2

- Improve scalability of SSH execution mode.
- Expand unit and regression tests. Audit test coverage and improve it.
- Reduce the differences between filesystem and object testing execution
  & reporting.
- Block storage (without filesystems) if necessary
- Add support for GDS?
